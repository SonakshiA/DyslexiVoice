# Text_To_Speech
Created a text-to-speech Android application for students with dyslexia

The application uses OpenDyslexic font family to improve focus and readability and highlights the word that is being spoken for better understanding.

The user can also adjust the font size and speech rate as per their needs.

The UI colors are chosen so as to avoid stark contrast.
